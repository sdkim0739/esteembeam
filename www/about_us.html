<h1>About EsteemBeam, the Company</h1>
<p>Hello! We, a team of highschool girls, have created this app for you because we truly believe that having a high self-esteem and loving yourself is necessary in being successful and leading a happy life. Our team includes 6 girls: Shagun Varma, Stephanie Kim, Julia Delgado, Rafiya Awan, Maya Ostrowski, and Monica Para. We have made/coded this application from scratch and could not have done it if we, ourselves, did not have confidence in our abliities and believe in ourselves.
<p>Our Mission: To provide services to the user to boost their self-esteem, in
the end, making them love and accept themselves. When a person has self-love, one can
perform better in almost all areas of life.</p>
<p>Our Vision: To make EsteemBeam a market leader in providing digital
self-help services to digitally savvy teens and of building a loyal
following of users.</p>
<p>We hope that this app helps you realize what an amazing, beautiful, valuable person you are and allow you to unlock the wonderous potential that you have.</p>
